<p>Imagine a traditional classroom with a teacher and a group of students.
 Depending on the class roster, 
 a single lecture could be given to 
 people with various knowledge levels.
 These situations present a difficult 
 choice for teachers: Either repeat the 
 material and lose time, or go ahead and 
 risk being misunderstood. It is also important
 that the students are fully involved in the studying process.
 A skilled teacher always watches for feedback and encourages discussion.
 However, often the topic of the lecture itself implies a different delivery mode, 
 more conducive to studying in a real working environment instead of a classroom.

The analysis of such situations shows that effective eLearning can take the best
 from traditional education and even surpass it. Modern learning tools should allow
 instructors and students to create, edit, and comment on all presented materials. This 
 will encourage discussion and keep everybody updated on the latest news. Webinars
 and instant messages in chats are especially necessary in the corporate sector, for 
 example when new products are put on the market and the first hands-on experiences are
 highly valued.
